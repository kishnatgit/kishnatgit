    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. Though you've stopped at 'About Me' section of my webpage I assume you want to
        learn something about me. <br> I am Uttam Kumar Maharana from MCA branch at IMIT College,Cuttack having
        Redg.No.2005102089
        trying to learn html to make attractive webpages.<br>This is my first webpage. Be my guest and feel free to
        browse
        my page. Thank you!</p>
    <h3>My Goals:</h3>
    <p>I am currently taking HTML classes at IMIT along with <i style=color:red>Class2, Class3</i>. My goals in this
        class are:
    <ul style=color:red>
        <li>Web page Developer</li>
        <li>Software Developer</li>
        <li>Full Stack Developer</li>
    </ul>
    In the past 2 weeks I have learned about basics of HTML. To create an HTMl page you need
    to have the following page structure: <br>
    <pre style="color: green;"><b>  
      &lt;html&gt;

            &lt;head&gt;
                  &lt;title&gt;My First WebPage&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;

            &lt;body&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Welcome to My WebPage&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;

      &lt;/html&gt;
    </b>
    </pre>
    </p>
